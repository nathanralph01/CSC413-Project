# CSC413 Project - Children's Story Generator

Generate a children's story with the reading level using bidirectional RNNs.

Combined the following two datasets:
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/edenbd/children-stories-text-corpus
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cuddlefish/fairy-tales

## How to run:
- Please make sure to run on GPU for faster response time
- To train the model based on your own hyperparameter,
modify and run train.py
- To test out the performance of the generator, run main.py
and type the prompt to generate a story.
